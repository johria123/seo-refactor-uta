# created a webpage using HTML along with CSS
worked on implementing a story
as a student I needed to make some changes to the HTML file where <div> WAS not used and tags like header, section, and article was replaced

## What technology I used
Used many technology factors such as HTML and CSS and GIT.
what manly was done in this challenge was to make all the div properties be replaced with semantic structure as in section, article, and header


Each div tag was substitued for header, section and article.
Each attribute was given a section tag 
Each sub-attribute was given a article tag
The title was changed to Horiseon
In the CSS file the .header was changed to header
Also remove the class attribute from the parent div

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
