# creadted a webage using HTML along with CSS
worked on implementing a story
as a student i needed to make some changes to the HTML file where <div> were not used and tags like header, section, and articles were used instead

## What technology I used
Used many technology factors such as HTML and CSS and GIT.
what manly was done in this challenge was to make all the <div> properties be replaced with semantic structure as in section, article, and header


Each <div> tag was substitued for header, section and article.
Each attribute was given a section tag 
Each sub-class was given a aricle tag
The title was changed to Horison
In the CSS file the .header was changed to header
Also remove the clss attribute from the parent <div>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
